#### Directory  
This does not have to be an absolute path however, whatever directory you point the script to needs to not have any other directories within it. 
This might be changed later down the line. But, as this is a personal tool, optimizations may not be implemented.

#### Verbosity
The "-v" option just spits out a little bit more information (i.e. it looks cool and doesn't do much else).
